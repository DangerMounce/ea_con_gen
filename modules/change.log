In this update:

ðŸ‘‰ Chat Repo Updating Fix
Chat updates were not being triggered upon first installation.


ðŸ‘‰ NPM Package Installer Script
Where ea_con_gen updates require additional packages, using "node install" will download and install the required packages.

ðŸ‘‰ Auto-Gen meta-data
AI genereated contacts are saved with a UUID as the filename in the relevant call/ticket directory.
When these are randomly selected for upload, the filename meta-data will now be "Auto-Gen" rather than the UUID.

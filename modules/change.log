In this update:

ðŸ‘‰ NPM Package Installer Script
Where ea_con_gen updates require additional packages, using "node install" will download and install the required packages.

ðŸ‘‰ Auto-Gen meta-data
AI genereated contacts are saved with a UUID as the filename in the relevant call/ticket directory.
When these are randomly selected for upload, the filename meta-data will now be "Auto-Gen" rather than the UUID.

ðŸ‘‰ Force update
If an error is preventing the current version of ea_con_gen from running correctly.  An update from the repo can be forced.
To force an update:
'cd modules'
'node force'

ðŸ‘‰ Call and Chat Library Syncing
When new calls or chats have been added to the repositary, you will be prompted to update.  This will sync your local contact folder with the repositary.
Any existing files you have will not be overwritten.  Library status will be shown on the cluster selection menu.

ðŸ‘‰ node gen clear [chats / calls]
This will clear the selected contact folder.  Files will be deleted.

ðŸ‘‰ Improved logging
The format of the log is now a plain text file for easier viewing and no longer clears at the start of each run.  Log can now be viewed with 'node gen log'
Log can be cleared with 'node gen clear log'

ðŸ‘‰ Version number
Removed ea_con_gen and version number from titleText.  Version can now be checked with 'node gen ver'.

ðŸ‘‰ Force update
Force the app, and contact librarys, to update with 'node gen update'
When you run the updated script, you will be prompted to update the contact librarys. 

ðŸ‘‰ View Change Log
Viewing the current change log can be done with 'node gen changelog'

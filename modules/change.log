In this update:

ðŸ‘‰ [node gen import]
Imports conversation from script.csv located in root directory.  CSV headers must be "message" (message response) and "speaker_is_customer" (true/false).

ðŸ‘‰ If the number of contacts to create is only 1, there will be no prompt for a time interval.

ðŸ‘‰ Guidance on adding API keys
If there's no API keys in the keyFile, guidance now added on how to add contracts.

ðŸ‘‰ Chat Repo Updating Fix
Chat updates were not being triggered upon first installation.

ðŸ‘‰ NPM Package Installer Script
Where ea_con_gen updates require additional packages, using [node install] will download and install the required packages.

ðŸ‘‰ Auto-Gen meta-data
AI genereated contacts are saved with a UUID as the filename in the relevant call/ticket directory.
When these are randomly selected for upload, the filename meta-data will now be "Auto-Gen" rather than the UUID.
